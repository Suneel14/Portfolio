## Design Choices
1. **Color Scheme:**
   - A gradient background with shades of blue (`#1e3c72` to `#2a5298`) was chosen to create a professional and visually calming aesthetic.
   - Accent colors like green (`#4CAF50`) are used for buttons, links, and section highlights to maintain consistency and draw attention.
2. **Typography:**
   - The `Poppins` font was selected for its modern and clean look, ensuring readability and elegance.
   - Headers and text are styled with appropriate sizes and weights to create a clear hierarchy.
3. **Layout:**
   - A responsive layout ensures the website looks good on all devices, with sections centrally aligned for a clean, professional appearance.
   - Sticky navigation at the top provides easy access to different sections.
4. **Sections:**
   - **Skills, Projects, Education, and Contact:** These sections are clearly separated with headers and unique backgrounds to make content easily scannable.
   - Cards and lists are used for better organization of information.
5. **Interactivity:**
   - Smooth hover effects on navigation links and project cards enhance user engagement.
   - Transition animations (e.g., hover shadows) make interactions feel dynamic and polished.

## Approach
1. **Planning:**
   - The website structure was planned to align with the key elements of a professional portfolio: introduction, skills, projects, education, and contact information.
   - A consistent style was maintained throughout the design to ensure cohesion.
2. **Development:**
   - HTML5 was used for semantic structure, ensuring the content is well-organized and accessible.
   - CSS3 was employed to add styles, including gradients, shadows, and animations for visual appeal.
   - A mobile-first approach was taken to ensure responsiveness.
3. **Testing:**
   - The design was tested on various screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
   - Different browsers were used to verify compatibility and consistent rendering.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensuring all elements, especially the navigation bar and project cards, adapted well to different screen sizes was a challenge.
   - This was resolved using flexible layouts, percentage-based widths, and media queries.
2. **Visual Consistency:**
   - Balancing visual appeal with readability required multiple iterations, particularly in selecting the right font sizes and colors.
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**
   - Minor inconsistencies in rendering between browsers were addressed by testing on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge and making necessary CSS adjustments.

## Future Improvements
1. **Dynamic Content:**
   - Integrate JavaScript to add interactivity, such as a toggle for dark mode or an animated scrolling effect.
2. **Backend Integration:**
   - Add a contact form with backend functionality to collect messages directly.
3. **Accessibility:**
   - Improve accessibility by ensuring proper ARIA roles and testing with screen readers.
4. **Project Previews:**
   - Include live previews or screenshots of projects for a more interactive experience.
